# Simple App JS

Welcome to Simple App JS, all and only Javascript you need in order to build Web Applications.

## Context

This is a explanatory repo that shows it's possible to build web application with a minimum knowledge of DOM and some expertise in Typescipt. The goal here is to demonstrate to new web development learners that that is life outside main market frameworks, being perfectly possible building web application with only a ordinary train of thought.

## How does it work

This app consists in a single App class (around 80 lines) that handles the logic of building a main content (the part of layout that never changes) and the varying content provided by Page Controllers according to the URL being reached.

## Using Simple App JS

Simple APP JS uses parcel as its bundler and to see it working in your local, just clone this repo, run npm install and then npm run start. If you want to check test coverage, npm run test.

### Usage example

In this same repository you can find an usage example of Simple App JS on ["https://github.com/drigomedeiros/simpleappjs/tree/admin-lte"] (branch admin-lte). Do the same steps to have the application builded: 1) `npm install`; 2) `npm run start`. Access [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234) in the browser and see it working.

In this example I'm reproducing the AdminLTE showcase.

## Final words

The purpose of this tool is not to argue against JS frameworks. They are important and I hope you get the will of learning them, but bearing in mind that they are not the only way to build web applications is important the same.

Hope you enjoy! Be happy!
